# Py-Sen Game

This is a Py-Sen game for a docker+python test.

Note that Py-Sen is a Taiwanese term :) 

## Usage
### Build image

`docker build -t {image_name} .`

### Run the image

Use '-i' so the script can be interactive.

`docker run -i {image_name}`

### Helper

I made a `help` command like a regular shell have :)

## What's Next?
* docker-compose
* Run on K8S
